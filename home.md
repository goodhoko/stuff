A list of stuff I'd like to have in my home some day.

## SunBeam automatic toaster
Magic toaster from the sixties that lowers and pops the bread automatically. The timing is 'radiant controlled' wich means the thermostat probes the temprature (and therefore darkness) of the bread itself. And the design is a lick!
